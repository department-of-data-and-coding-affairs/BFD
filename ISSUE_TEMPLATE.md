If you are reporting an issue, we expect you to follow the spirit of
[being together](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

If appropriate, it would be helpful to know:

* What you were trying to do,
* What steps you took to make this happen,
* What you expected to happen,
* What actually happened,
* Why this difference is problematic (it may not be a bug!),
* Technical details like the version of BFD you're using, your OS version and
  other aspects of the context in which BFD was running. 

Thank you for contributing to BFD!
