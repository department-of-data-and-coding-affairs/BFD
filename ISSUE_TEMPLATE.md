We welcome bug reports, constructive criticism and realistic suggestions.
Please remember that BFD is made by volunteers as a labour of love. Friendly
and compassionate engagement wins every time.

If you are reporting a bug, we would like to know:

* What you were trying to do,
* What steps you took to make this happen,
* What you expected to happen,
* What actually happened,
* Why this difference is problematic (it may not be a bug!),
* Technical details like the version of BFD you're using, your OS version and
  other aspects of the context in which BFD was running. 

Thank you for contributing to BFD! :-)
