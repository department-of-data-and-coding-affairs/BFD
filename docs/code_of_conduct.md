# The Creator's Code

Because we are limited beings,  
we make choices that are unwise or flawed.

While others may meet us with hostility,  
we choose to acknowledge difference:

Thus we forgive.

This is a place of learning, understanding, teaching and sharing.  
This is a place to affirm valour and compassion.  
This is a place for collaborative creation.  

Be well, Creator. Be well and create.
